## Versioning Scheme

Laravel and its other first-party packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Major framework releases are released every six months (February and August), while minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should **never** contain breaking changes.

When referencing the Laravel framework or its components from your application or package, you should always use a version constraint such as `^7.0`, since major releases of Laravel do include breaking changes. However, we strive to always ensure you may update to a new major release in one day or less.

## Support Policy

For LTS releases, such as Laravel 6, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3 years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year. For all additional libraries, including Lumen, only the latest release receives bug fixes. In addition, please review the database versions [supported by Laravel](/docs/{{version}}/database#introduction).
